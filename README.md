# racket-html-parser

Programming assignment for CSC324 - Principles of Programming Languages.

One of the most fundamental tasks in computer science is parsing: taking in some input (usually but not always in text format) and recovering meaningful data from it. In this assignment, we'll focus on parsing HTML, taking a string of HTML text and then recovering the underlying tree structure from it.
